# 📝 Todo App

This is a **simple Todo App** built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It allows users to **add tasks**, **mark them as completed**, and **delete tasks** — all with a clean and minimal UI.  
This project marks my **first step in learning React with TypeScript**.

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Add new todos  
- ✅ Toggle completion (click to mark done)  
- ❌ Delete tasks  
- 🎨 Styled using Tailwind CSS  
- ⚡ Fast setup and live updates with Vite

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Creating **React functional components**  
- Managing **state** using `useState`  
- Passing props between parent and child components  
- Using **TypeScript interfaces** for type safety  
- Applying **Tailwind CSS** classes for quick styling
